  message: "When generating random data for use in cryptographic operations, such\
    \ as an initialization vector, you do not want to use the standard random module\
    \ APIs. This is because they do not provide a cryptographically secure random\
    \ number generator, which can result in major security issues depending on the\
    \ algorithms in use. Therefore, it is our recommendation to always use your operating\
    \ system\u2019s provided random number generator, which is available as os.urandom()."
