  message: Untrusted input might be used to build a database query, which can lead
    to a SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker can execute malicious SQL statements
    and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify, delete data, or execute
    arbitrary system commands. Peewee provides a query builder which should allow
    to create the SQL query in a safe way. If you cannot use it, make sure to check
    the value exists in an allowlist, such that no user-controllable value can influence
