  message: The application may convert user-controlled data into an object, which
    can lead to an insecure deserialization vulnerability. An attacker can create
    a malicious serialized object, pass it to the application, and take advantage
    of the deserialization process to perform Denial-of-service (DoS), Remote code
    execution (RCE), or bypass access control measures. Starting from `ruamel.yaml`
    version 0.15.0 the default loader (`typ='rt'`) is a direct derivative of the safe
    loader. Before this version, use the optional argument `Loader` with value `SafeLoader`
    or `CSafeLoader`, or use the `safe_load` function.
