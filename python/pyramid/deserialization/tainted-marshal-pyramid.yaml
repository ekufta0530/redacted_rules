  message: 'The application may convert user-controlled data into an object, which
    can lead to an insecure deserialization vulnerability. An attacker can create
    a malicious serialized object, pass it to the application, and take advantage
    of the deserialization process to perform Denial-of-service (DoS), Remote code
    execution (RCE), or bypass access control measures. To prevent this vulnerability,
    leverage data formats such as JSON or XML as safer alternatives. If you need to
    deserialize user input in a specific format, consider digitally signing the data
    before serialization to prevent tampering. For more information, see: [Deserialization
    prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html)
    The `marshal` module is not intended to be secure against erroneous or maliciously
    constructed data. Never unmarshal data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated
    source. For deserializing data from untrusted sources we recommend using YAML
    or JSON libraries with built-in protections, such as json, PyYAML, or ruamel.yaml.'
