  message: The application may convert user-controlled data into an object, which
    can lead to an insecure deserialization vulnerability. An attacker can create
    a malicious serialized object, pass it to the application, and take advantage
    of the deserialization process to perform Denial-of-service (DoS), Remote code
    execution (RCE), or bypass access control measures. The `marshal` module is not
    intended to be secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Never
    unmarshal data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source. For deserializing
    data from untrusted sources we recommend using YAML or JSON libraries with built-in
    protections, such as json, PyYAML, or ruamel.yaml.
