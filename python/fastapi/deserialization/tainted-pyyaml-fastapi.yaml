  message: The application may convert user-controlled data into an object, which
    can lead to an insecure deserialization vulnerability. An attacker can create
    a malicious serialized object, pass it to the application, and take advantage
    of the deserialization process to perform Denial-of-service (DoS), Remote code
    execution (RCE), or bypass access control measures. PyYAML's `yaml` module is
    as powerful as `pickle` and so may call auny Python function. It is recommended
    to secure your application by using `yaml.SafeLoader` or `yaml.CSafeLoader`.
