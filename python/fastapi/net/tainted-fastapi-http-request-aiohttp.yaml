  message: Untrusted input might be used to build an HTTP request, which can lead
    to a Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. SSRF allows an attacker
    to send crafted requests from the server side to other internal or external systems.
    SSRF can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and, in some cases, allow
    the attacker to control applications or systems that trust the vulnerable service.
    To prevent this vulnerability, avoid allowing user input to craft the base request.
    Instead, treat it as part of the path or query parameter and encode it appropriately.
    When user input is necessary to prepare the HTTP request, perform strict input
    validation. Additionally, whenever possible, use allowlists to only interact with
    expected, trusted domains.
