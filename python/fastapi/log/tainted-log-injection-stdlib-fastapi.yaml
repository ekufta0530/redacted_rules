  message: Detected a logger that logs user input without properly neutralizing the
    output. The log message could contain characters like ` ` and ` ` and cause an
    attacker to forge log entries or include malicious content into the logs. Use
    proper input validation and/or output encoding to prevent log entries from being
    forged.
