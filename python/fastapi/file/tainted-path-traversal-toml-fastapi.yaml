  message: The application builds a file path from potentially untrusted data, which
    can lead to a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the path
    which the application uses to access files. If the application does not validate
    user input and sanitize file paths, sensitive files such as configuration or user
    data can be accessed, potentially creating or overwriting files. In FastAPI apps,
    consider using the Starlette `:path` annotation in the route declaration to automatically
    sanitize paths and filenames.
