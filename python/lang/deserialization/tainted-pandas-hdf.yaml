  message: The application may convert user-controlled data into an object, which
    can lead to an insecure deserialization vulnerability. An attacker can create
    a malicious serialized object, pass it to the application, and take advantage
    of the deserialization process to perform Denial-of-service (DoS), Remote code
    execution (RCE), or bypass access control measures. The `pandas.read_hdf()` function
    uses `pickle` when the `fixed` format is used during serializing. This function
    should not be used with untrusted data.
