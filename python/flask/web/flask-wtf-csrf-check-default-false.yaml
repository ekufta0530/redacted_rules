  message: The application does not appear to verify inbound requests which can lead
    to a Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. If the application uses
    cookie-based authentication, an attacker can trick users into sending authenticated
    HTTP requests without their knowledge from any arbitrary domain they visit. With
    `WTF_CSRF_CHECK_DEFAULT` set to `False` the CSRF tokens are still enabled and
    included, but the check no longer happens automatically. Doing the check manually
    requires a call to `csrf.protect()` before handling the request. An appropriate
    place to do this is a `@app.before_request` decorated function.
