  message: The application may convert user-controlled data into an object, which
    can lead to an insecure deserialization vulnerability. An attacker can create
    a malicious serialized object, pass it to the application, and take advantage
    of the deserialization process to perform Denial-of-service (DoS), Remote code
    execution (RCE), or bypass access control measures. The `dill` module allows arbitrary
    user defined classes and functions to be serialized. We do not recommend using
    it for unpickling data from untrusted sources. For deserializing data from untrusted
    sources we recommend using YAML or JSON libraries with built-in protections.
