  message: The application may convert user-controlled data into an object, which
    can lead to an insecure deserialization vulnerability. An attacker can create
    a malicious serialized object, pass it to the application, and take advantage
    of the deserialization process to perform Denial-of-service (DoS), Remote code
    execution (RCE), or bypass access control measures. The `jsonpickle` module can
    execute arbitrary Python code. Do not load `jsonpickles` from untrusted sources.
    For deserializing data from untrusted sources we recommend using YAML or JSON
    libraries with built-in protections, such as json, PyYAML, or ruamel.yaml.
