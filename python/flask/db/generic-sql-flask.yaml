  message: Untrusted input might be used to build a database query, which can lead
    to a SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker can execute malicious SQL statements
    and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify, delete data, or execute
    arbitrary system commands. The driver API has the ability to bind parameters to
    the query in a safe way. Make sure not to dynamically create SQL queries from
    user-influenced inputs. If you cannot avoid this, either escape the data properly
    or create an allowlist to check the value.
