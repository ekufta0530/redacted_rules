  message: The application builds a file path from potentially untrusted data, which
    can lead to a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the path
    which the application uses to access files. If the application does not validate
    user input and sanitize file paths, sensitive files such as configuration or user
    data can be accessed, potentially creating or overwriting files. In Flask apps,
    consider using the Werkzeug util `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename()` to sanitize
    paths and filenames.
