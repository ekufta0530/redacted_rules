  message: Detected use of the `none` algorithm in a JWT token. The `none` algorithm
    assumes the integrity of the token has already been verified. This would allow
    a malicious actor to forge a JWT token that will automatically be verified. Do
    not explicitly use the `none` algorithm. Instead, use an algorithm such as `HS256`.
