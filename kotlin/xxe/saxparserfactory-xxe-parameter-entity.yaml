  message: 'The application is using an XML parser that has not been safely configured.
    This might lead to XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities when parsing user-controlled
    input. An attacker can include document type definitions (DTDs) which can interact
    with internal or external hosts. XXE can lead to other vulnerabilities, such as
    Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and Server-side request
    forgery (SSRF), depending on the application configuration. An attacker can also
    use DTDs to expand recursively, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, also
    known as a `Billion Laughs Attack`. The current configuration allows for XXE attacks
    through parameter entities. It is our recommendation to secure this parser against
    all types of XXE attacks by configuring $FACTORY with `$FACTORY.setFeature(http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl,
    true)`. Alternatively, the following configurations also provide protection against
    XXE attacks with parameter entities. `$FACTORY.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING,
    true)` `$FACTORY.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities",
    false)` `$PARSER.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "")`. The best
    defense against XXE is to have an XML parser that supports disabling DTDs. Limiting
    the use of external entities from the start can prevent the parser from being
    used to process untrusted XML files. Reducing dependencies on external resources
    is also a good practice for performance reasons. It is difficult to guarantee
    that even a trusted XML file on your server or during transmission has not been
    tampered with by a malicious third-party. For more information, see: [Java XXE
