- id: open-redirect
  message: The application builds a URL using user-controlled input which can lead
    to an open redirect vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the URL and redirect
    users to an arbitrary domain. Open redirect vulnerabilities can lead to issues
    such as Cross-site scripting (XSS) or redirecting to a malicious domain for activities
    such as phishing to capture users' credentials. To prevent this vulnerability
    perform strict input validation of the domain against an allowlist of approved
    domains. Notify a user in your application that they are leaving the website.
    Display a domain where they are redirected to the user. A user can then either
    accept or deny the redirect to an untrusted site.
