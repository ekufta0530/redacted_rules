- id: session-fixation
  message: Detected `$REQ` argument which enters `$RES.$HEADER`, this can lead to
    session fixation vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the cookie value.
    This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to accounts, and in some esoteric
    cases, Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS). Users should not be able to influence cookies
    directly, for session cookies, they should be generated securely using an approved
    session management library. If the cookie does need to be set by a user, consider
    using an allow-list based approach to restrict the cookies which can be set.
