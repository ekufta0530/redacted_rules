  message: 'Detected `$REQ` argument enters calls to `RegExp`. This could lead to
    a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) through catastrophic backtracking.
    If the input is attacker controllable, this vulnerability can lead to systems
    being non-responsive or may crash due to ReDoS. Where possible avoid calls to
    `RegExp` with user input, if required ensure user input is escaped or validated. '
