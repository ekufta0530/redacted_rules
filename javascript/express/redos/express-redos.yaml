  message: The regular expression identified appears vulnerable to Regular Expression
    Denial of Service (ReDoS) through catastrophic backtracking. If the input is attacker
    controllable, this vulnerability can lead to systems being non-responsive or may
    crash due to ReDoS. Where possible, re-write the regex so as not to leverage backtracking
    or use a library that offers default protection against ReDoS.
