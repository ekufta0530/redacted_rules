  message: The SHA1 hashing algorithm is considered to be weak. If this is used in
    any sensitive operation such as password hashing, or is used to ensure data integrity
    (collision sensitive) then you should use a stronger hashing algorithm. For passwords,
    consider using `Argon2id`, `scrypt`, or `bcrypt`. For data integrity, consider
    using `SHA-256`.
