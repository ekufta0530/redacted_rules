  message: Detected the use of `$METHOD("$VALUE")` which is considered a weak cryptographic
    algorithm. Where possible, leverage the industry standard recommendation which
    is to use a block cipher such as `AES` with at least `128-bit` strength, an example
    of a secure algorithm is `AES-256-GCM`. If your company has its own guidelines,
    you should follow your company's internal best practices.
