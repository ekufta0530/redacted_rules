  message: Untrusted input might be used to build a database query, which can lead
    to a NoSQL injection vulnerability. An attacker can execute malicious NoSQL statements
    and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify, delete data, or execute
    arbitrary system commands. Make sure all user input is validated and sanitized,
    and avoid using tainted user input to construct NoSQL statements if possible.
    Ideally, avoid raw queries and instead use parameterized queries.
