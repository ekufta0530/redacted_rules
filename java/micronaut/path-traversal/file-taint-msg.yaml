  message: The application builds a file path from potentially untrusted data, which
    can lead to a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the path
    which the application uses to access files. If the application does not validate
    user input and sanitize file paths, sensitive files such as configuration or user
    data can be accessed, potentially creating or overwriting files. To prevent this
    vulnerability, validate and sanitize any input that is used to create references
    to file paths. Also, enforce strict file access controls. For example, choose
    privileges allowing public-facing applications to access only the required files.
    In Java, you may also consider using a utility method such as `org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils.getName(...)`
    to only retrieve the file name from the path.
