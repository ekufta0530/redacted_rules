  message: 'The application is using an XML parser that has not been safely configured.
    This might lead to XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities when parsing user-controlled
    input. An attacker can include document type definitions (DTDs) which can interact
    with internal or external hosts. XXE can lead to other vulnerabilities, such as
    Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and Server-side request
    forgery (SSRF), depending on the application configuration. An attacker can also
    use DTDs to expand recursively, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, also
    known as a Billion Laughs Attack. The XML parser $PARSER is not securely configured.
    The current configuration allows for XXE attacks. It is our recommendation to
    secure this parser against XXE attacks by configuring $PARSER with `$PARSER.setFeature(http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl,
    true)`. Alternatively, the following configurations also provide protection against
    XXE attacks. `$PARSER.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "")` `$PARSER.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities",
    false)` `$PARSER.setExpandEntities(false)` It is also possible to use one of the
    constructor parameters that will result in a more secure parser by default: `new
    SAXBuilder(XMLReaders.DTDVALIDATING)` or `new SAXBuilder(XMLReaders.XSDVALIDATING)`.
