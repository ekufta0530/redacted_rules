  message: 'The application is using an XML parser that has not been safely configured.
    This might lead to XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities when parsing user-controlled
    input. An attacker can include document type definitions (DTDs) which can interact
    with internal or external hosts. XXE can lead to other vulnerabilities, such as
    Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and Server-side request
    forgery (SSRF), depending on the application configuration. An attacker can also
    use DTDs to expand recursively, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, also
    known as a Billion Laughs Attack. The constructor for SAXReader has an optional
    XMLReader argument. However, configuring this XMLReader before using it in the
    constructor has no effect on the security of the SAXReader. The SAXReader itself
    needs to be configured to prevent XXE vulnerabilities. For more information, see:
    [Java XXE prevention](https://semgrep.dev/docs/cheat-sheets/java-xxe/)'
