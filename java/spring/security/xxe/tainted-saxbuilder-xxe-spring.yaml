  message: 'The application is using an XML parser that has not been safely configured.
    This might lead to XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities when parsing user-controlled
    input. An attacker can include document type definitions (DTDs) or XIncludes which
    can interact with internal or external hosts. XXE can lead to other vulnerabilities,
    such as Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and Server-side
    request forgery (SSRF), depending on the application configuration. An attacker
    can also use DTDs to expand recursively, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS)
    attack, also known as a `Billion Laughs Attack`. It is our recommendation to secure
    this parser against XXE attacks by configuring the SAXBuilder parser with `parser.setFeature(http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl,
    true)`. Alternatively, the following configurations also provide protection against
    XXE attacks. `parser.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "")`, enabling
    both of `parser.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities",
    false)` and `parser.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities",
    false)`, and enabling both of `parser.setExpandEntities(false)` and parser.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities",
    false)` It is also possible to use one of the constructor parameters that will
    result in a more secure parser by default: `new SAXBuilder(XMLReaders.DTDVALIDATING)`
    or `new SAXBuilder(XMLReaders.XSDVALIDATING)`. For more information, see: [Java
    XXE prevention](https://semgrep.dev/docs/cheat-sheets/java-xxe/)'
