  message: The application stores potentially sensitive information in log files.
    This could lead to a vulnerability, if an attacker can gain access to logs and
    then use the sensitive information to perform further attacks. When dealing with
    HTTP requests, sensitive data could be, for instance, JWT tokens or other session
    identifiers. To prevent this vulnerability review the type of information being
    logged. Sensitive information can be identified and filtered or obfuscated before
    calling logging functions.
