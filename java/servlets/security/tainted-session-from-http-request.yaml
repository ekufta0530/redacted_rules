  message: Detected input from a HTTPServletRequest going into a session command,
    like `setAttribute`. User input into such a command could lead to an attacker
    inputting malicious code into your session parameters, blurring the line between
    what's trusted and untrusted, and therefore leading to a trust boundary violation.
    This could lead to programmers trusting unvalidated data. Instead, thoroughly
    sanitize user input before passing it into such function calls.
