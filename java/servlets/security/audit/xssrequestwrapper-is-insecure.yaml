  message: It looks like you're using an implementation of XSSRequestWrapper from
    dzone. (https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2012/07/anti-cross-site-scripting-xss-filter.html)
    XSS vulnerabilities occur when untrusted input executes malicious JavaScript code,
    leading to issues such as account compromise and sensitive information leakage.
    The XSS filtering in this code is not secure and can be bypassed by malicious
    actors. It is recommended to use a stack that automatically escapes your view
    or templates instead of filtering yourself.
