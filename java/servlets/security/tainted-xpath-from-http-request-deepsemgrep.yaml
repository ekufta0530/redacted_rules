  message: XPath queries are constructed dynamically on user-controlled input. This
    could lead to XPath injection if variables passed into the evaluate or compile
    commands are not properly sanitized. Xpath injection could lead to unauthorized
    access to sensitive information in XML documents. Thoroughly sanitize user input
    or use parameterized XPath queries if you can.
