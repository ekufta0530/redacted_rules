    This might lead to XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities when parsing user-controlled
    input. An attacker can include document type definitions (DTDs) which can interact
    with internal or external hosts. XXE can lead to other vulnerabilities, such as
    Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and Server-side request
    forgery (SSRF), depending on the application configuration. An attacker can also
    use DTDs to expand recursively, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, also
    known as a Billion Laughs Attack. It is our recommendation to secure this parser
    against XXE attacks by configuring the XMLReader parser with `parser.setFeature(http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl,
    true)`. Alternatively, the following configurations also provide protection against
    XXE attacks. `parser.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD,"")`, configuring
    the both of `parser.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities",
    false)` and `parser.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities",
    false)`. For more information, see: [Java XXE prevention](https://semgrep.dev/docs/cheat-sheets/java-xxe/)'
