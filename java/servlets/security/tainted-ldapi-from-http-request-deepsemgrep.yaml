  message: Untrusted input might be used to build an LDAP query, which can allow attackers
    to run arbitrary LDAP queries. If an LDAP query must contain untrusted input then
    it must be escaped. Ensure data passed to an LDAP query is not controllable or
    properly sanitize the user input with functions like createEqualityFilter.
