  message: Untrusted input could be used to tamper with a web page rendering, which
    can lead to a Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. XSS vulnerabilities occur
    when untrusted input executes malicious JavaScript code, leading to issues such
    as account compromise and sensitive information leakage. Validate the user input,
    perform contextual output encoding, or sanitize the input. If you have to use
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML, consider using a sanitization library such as DOMPurify
    to sanitize the HTML within.
