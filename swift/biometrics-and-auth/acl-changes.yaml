  message: The application was observed to store keychain items that leverage biometric
    protection, but allow for biometry changes. This means that an attacker with knowledge
    of the victim's passcode or the ability to guess the passcode - can register their
    own biometrics, and bypass this keychain authentication mechanism within the app.
    The application should store keychain entries with `biometryCurrentSet` rather
    than `biometryAny` or `userPresence`.
