  message: The application was observed to leverage biometrics via Local Authentication,
    which returns a simple boolean result for authentication. This design is subject
    to bypass with runtime tampering tools such as Frida, Substrate, and others. Although
    this is limited to rooted (jailbroken) devices, consider implementing biometric
    authentication the reliable way - via Keychain Services.
