  message: The application was observed to leverage biometrics, without verifying
    that biometric changes have not taken place. Failure to do so means that an attacker
    with knowledge of the victim's passcode or the ability to guess the passcode -
    can register their own biometrics, and bypass the authentication mechanism within
    the app. The application should check first that biometric changes have not been
    made, then proceed.
