  message: Webviews were observed to load content where the `allowingReadAccessTo`
    parameter is a directory, rather than a single file. If a single file is passed
    as a parameter, then only that single file is accessible, but passing a directory,
    is potentially over permissive. Consider whether this functionality is indeed
    required.
