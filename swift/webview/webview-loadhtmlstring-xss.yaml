  message: Potential cross site scripting (XSS) occurs due to untrusted input being
    loaded into a WebView. The impact of such issues can vary depending on the features,
    permissions and exposure of data & functionality that the WebView contains. For
    example, in some applications the presence of JavaScript bridges may allow for
    the instrumentation of application code, and potentially arbitrary code execution
    in the context of the app. In other instances, it may be possible to manipulate
    the DOM to redraw the UI and phish users, or conduct other typical XSS attacks.
