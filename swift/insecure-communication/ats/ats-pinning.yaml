  message: The application's App Transport Security (ATS) configuration does not leverage
    the in-built public key pinning mechanisms. The application should consider leverage
    ATS public key pinning to ensure that the application only communicates to serves
    with an allow-listed certificate (and public key). By default the device will
    allow connections if the default trust store (CA store) posesses the right certificates.
    The number of accepted Certificate Authorities by default is hundreds. Using public
    key pinning vastly reduces the attack surface.
