  message: The application's App Transport Security (ATS) configuration allows for
    insecure accessing of HTTP content in WebViews. This means that connections accessed
    in a WebView may be accessed via HTTP, potentially leaking that data to others
    on the local network, or to other network devices the network traffic traverses
    (proxies, firewalls, load balancers, etc).
