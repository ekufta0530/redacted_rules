  message: The application's App Transport Security (ATS) configuration allows for
    insecure accessing of media content over HTTP connections. This means that images,
    video, and other media (AVFoundation) data may be accessed via HTTP, potentially
    leaking that data to others on the local network, or to other network devices
    the network traffic traverses (proxies, firewalls, load balancers, etc).
