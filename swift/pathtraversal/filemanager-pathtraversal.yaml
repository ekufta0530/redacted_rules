  message: Path traversal may allow malicious actors to access file content not intended
    to be exposed to them. For example a user may be able to access sensitive secrets
    stored within app files (e.g. UserDefaults/Plists/.etc.). Alternatively, users
    with access to a victim's phone may be able to obtain senstivie data persisted
    by the application.
