  message: Key generation routines were identified where the resultant keys are not
    stored protected by the Secure Enclave. On iOS/macOS systems, cryptographic keys
    can be generated within the Secure Enclave - making them inaccessible to the rest
    of the system. The keys can be used for operations (signing, decryption, etc)
    but the private keys cannot be dumped or copied - even on rooted/jailbroken systems.
