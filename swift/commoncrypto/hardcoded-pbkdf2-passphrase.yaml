  message: A hardcoded passphrase was used with a call to the Password Based Key Derivation
    Function (PBKDF2) function which derives a cryptographic key from the password
    input. Because of this, the derived key is predictable and can be considered hard-coded
    too. Keys should be derived using a unique passphrase and randomly generated salt
    - per user.
