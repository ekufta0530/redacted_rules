  message: Initialization Vectors (IVs) for block ciphers should be randomly generated
    each time they are used. Using a static IV means the same plaintext encrypts to
    the same ciphertext every time, weakening the strength of the encryption.

  - 'CWE-329: Not using a random initialization Vector (IV) with Cipher Block Chaining
    (CBC) Mode causes algorithms to be susceptible to dictionary attacks.'
