  message: 'The use of the MD5 hashing algorithm was identified which is considered
    insecure. MD5 is not collision resistant and is therefore not suitable for cryptographic
    or secure use-cases. Use stronger algorithms such as SHA256, SHA512, or adaptive
    hashing algorithms such as argon2 or bcrypt. **Note**: MD5 is still considered
    acceptable when used for Message Authentication Purposes, e.g. with HMAC although
    better and stronger algorithms should be strongly considered.'
