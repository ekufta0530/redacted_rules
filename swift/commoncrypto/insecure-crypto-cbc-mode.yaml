  message: Symmetric cryptographic operations were identified that use Cipher Block
    Chaining (CBC) mode. AES in CBC mode provides unauthenticated cryptographic encryption.
    CBC is also malleable, meaning that an attacker can influence the decrypted plaintext
    by modifying bits of the ciphertext (bit flipping attacks). Consider using an
    authenticated encryption mechanism, such as AES-GCM or ChaChaPoly. If CBC mode
    is **required**, consider augmenting the encryption with authentication by signing
    the ciphertexts with a Message Authentication Code (e.g. HMAC).
