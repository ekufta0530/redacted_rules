  message: The use of the MD4 hashing algorithm was identified which is considered
    insecure. MD4 is not collision resistant and is therefore not suitable for cryptographic
    or secure use-cases. Use stronger algorithms such as SHA256, SHA512, or adaptive
    hashing algorithms such as argon2 or bcrypt.
