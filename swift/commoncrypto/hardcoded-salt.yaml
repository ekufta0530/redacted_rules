  message: Cryptographic operations were identified that leverage a hardcoded salt/nonce.
    A salt does not need to remain secret, but should be random, generated from cryptographically
    secure sources of entropy, such as an CSPRNG. On iOS/macOS platforms, secure random
    data can be obtained via the `SecCopyRandomBytes` API available from RandomizationServices.

  - 'CWE-323: Nonces should be used for the present occasion and only once.'
