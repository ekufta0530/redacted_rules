  message: The application was found to use nscoding, which is not considered secure.
    When decoding serialized objects, it is not possible to determine what they are,
    until post-decoding. `NSSecureCoding` should be used in place of nscoding, and
    secure serialization and deserialization should be used in all cases where such
    functionality is required.
