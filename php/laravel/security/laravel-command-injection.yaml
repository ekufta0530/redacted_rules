  message: Untrusted input might be injected into a command executed by the application,
    which can lead to a command injection vulnerability. An attacker can execute arbitrary
    commands, potentially gaining complete control of the system. To prevent this
    vulnerability, avoid executing OS commands with user input. If this is unavoidable,
    validate and sanitize the user input, and use safe methods for executing the commands.
    In PHP, it is possible to use `escapeshellcmd(...)` and `escapeshellarg(...)`
    to correctly sanitize input when used respectively as system commands or command
    arguments.
