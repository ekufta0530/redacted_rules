  message: The application appears to have disabled the CSRF token verification middleware
    which can lead to a Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. If the application
    uses cookie-based authentication, an attacker can trick users into sending authenticated
    HTTP requests without their knowledge from any arbitrary domain they visit. You
    can prevent this vulnerability by enforcing usage and verification of the CSRF
    tokens associated with user requests. To enable the CSRF token verification middleware
    add `\$APP\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken` to the middleware group in your `$APP\Http\Kernel`
    class.
