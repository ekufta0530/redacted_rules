  message: The application appears to have disabled the cookie encryption middleware
    which can lead to a Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. If the application
    uses cookie-based authentication, an attacker can trick users into sending authenticated
    HTTP requests without their knowledge from any arbitrary domain they visit. You
    can prevent this vulnerability by encrypting cookies if you use them to handle
    sessions or storing sensitive data. To enable the cookie encryption middleware
    add `\$APP\Http\Middleware\EncryptCookies` to the middleware group in your `$APP\Http\Kernel`
    class.
