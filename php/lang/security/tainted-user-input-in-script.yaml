- id: tainted-user-input-in-script
  message: Untrusted input could be used to tamper with a web page rendering, which
    can lead to a Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. XSS vulnerabilities occur
    when untrusted input executes malicious JavaScript code, leading to issues such
    as account compromise and sensitive information leakage. To prevent this vulnerability,
    validate the user input, perform contextual output encoding or sanitize the input.
    In PHP you can encode or sanitize user input with `htmlspecialchars` or use automatic
    context-aware escaping with a template engine such as Latte.
