  message: Found direct access to a PHP variable wihout HTML escaping inside an inline
    PHP statement setting data from `$_REQUEST[...]`. When untrusted input can be
    used to tamper with a web page rendering, it can lead to a Cross-site scripting
    (XSS) vulnerability. XSS vulnerabilities occur when untrusted input executes malicious
    JavaScript code, leading to issues such as account compromise and sensitive information
    leakage. To prevent this vulnerability, validate the user input, perform contextual
    output encoding or sanitize the input. In PHP you can encode or sanitize user
    input with `htmlspecialchars` or use automatic context-aware escaping with a template
    engine such as Latte.
