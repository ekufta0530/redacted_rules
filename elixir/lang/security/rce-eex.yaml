  message: 'Untrusted input might be injected into a evaluation statement executed
    by the application, which can lead to a remote code execution. An attacker can
    execute arbitrary Elixir code, potentially gaining complete control of the system.
    To prevent this vulnerability, avoid evaluating Elixir code with user input through
    the `EEx.eval_*` functions. If this is unavoidable, validate and sanitize the
    input, and use safe methods for executing the commands. '
