  message: 'Untrusted input might be injected into a command executed by the application,
    which can lead to a command injection vulnerability. An attacker can execute arbitrary
    commands, potentially gaining complete control of the system. To prevent this
    vulnerability, avoid executing OS commands with user input through the `:os.cmd`
    and `System.cmd` functions. If this is unavoidable, validate and sanitize the
    input, and use safe methods for executing the commands. '
