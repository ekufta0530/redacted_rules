- id: not-truthiness
  message: 'Elixir provides the concept of truthiness: nil and false are considered
    "falsy" and all other values are "truthy". Many constructs in the language, such
    as `&&/2`, `||/2`, and `!/1` handle truthy and falsy values. Using those operators
    is not an anti-pattern. However, using those operators when all operands are expected
    to be booleans, may be an anti-pattern and could lead to undefined behavior.'
