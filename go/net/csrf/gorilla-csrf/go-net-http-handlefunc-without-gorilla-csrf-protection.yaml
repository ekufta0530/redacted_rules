  message: The application does not appear to verify inbound requests which can lead
    to a Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. If the application uses
    cookie-based authentication, an attacker can trick users into sending authenticated
    HTTP requests without their knowledge from any arbitrary domain they visit. This
    vulnerability can be prevented by getting the CSRF token from the request and
    including it in a response header by including `$W.Header.Set(X-CSRF-Token", csrf.Token($R))`
    in the function before calling `$W.Write()`, or by wrapping the `$FUNC` call with
    `csrf.Protect(authKey)($FUNC)` and using a key retrieved for instance from an
    environment variable.
