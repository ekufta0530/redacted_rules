  message: 'The application does not appear to verify inbound requests which can lead
    to a Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. If the application uses
    cookie-based authentication, an attacker can trick users into sending authenticated
    HTTP requests without their knowledge from any arbitrary domain they visit. To
    prevent this vulnerability start by identifying if the framework or library leveraged
    has built-in features or offers plugins for CSRF protection. CSRF tokens should
    be unique and securely random. The `Synchronizer Token` or `Double Submit Cookie`
    patterns with defense-in-depth mechanisms such as the `sameSite` cookie flag can
    help prevent CSRF. For more information, see: [Cross-site request forgery prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)'
