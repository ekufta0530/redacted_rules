  message: These functions do not allow to set a a timeout value for reading requests.
    As a result, the app server may be vulnerable to a Slowloris Denial-of-Service
    (DoS) attack. Slowloris attacks exploit the fact that HTTP servers keep the connection
    active if the request received is incomplete. To mitigate this, implement a `Server`
    and set the timeout with `ReadHeaderTimeout`.
