  message: This server may be vulnerable to a Slowloris Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
    Slowloris attacks exploit the fact that HTTP servers keep the connection active
    if the request received is incomplete. By default, Go does not define a timeout
    value for `ReadHeaderTimeout`, which leaves your application vulnerable. To mitigate
    this, configure this parameter in your Server settings.
