  message: Untrusted input might be used to build a path, which can lead to a path
    traversal vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the path which the application
    uses to access files. If the application does not validate user input and sanitize
    file paths, sensitive files can be accessed, such as configuration files or user
    data, potentially creating or overwriting files. To prevent this vulnerability,
    validate and sanitize any input that is used to create references to file paths.
    Also, enforce strict file access controls. For example, choose privileges allowing
    public-facing applications to access only the required files. In Go, it is possible
    to sanitize user input and mitigate path traversal by using the `SecureJoin` function
    in `filepath-securejoin`.
