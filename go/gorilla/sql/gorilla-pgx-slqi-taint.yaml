  message: Untrusted input might be used to build a database query, which can lead
    to a SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker can execute malicious SQL statements
    and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify, delete data, or execute
    arbitrary system commands. Create parameterized queries in pgx by using positional
    parameters (`$1`, `$2`, ...) and adding the values as additional arguments to
    the function call. It is also possible to create prepared statements through the
    `Prepare` function. This function uses the same placeholders for bound parameters.
