  message: This call to `$MEMSET` may be optimized out by the compiler because the
    buffer is not accessed later in the function. This could be an issue if `$BUF`
    contains sensitive data, such as passwords or cryptographic keys. Applications
    should use functions such as `memset_s` or `memset_explicit` to ensure that the
    sensitive data is cleared.
