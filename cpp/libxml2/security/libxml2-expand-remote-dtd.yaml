  message: The application is using an XML parser that has not been safely configured.
    This might lead to XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities when parsing user-controlled
    input. An attacker can include document type definitions (DTDs) or XIncludes which
    can interact with internal or external hosts. XXE can lead to other vulnerabilities,
    such as Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and Server-side
    request forgery (SSRF), depending on the application configuration. An attacker
    can also use DTDs to expand recursively, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS)
    attack, also known as a `Billion Laughs Attack`. If DTD is required for local
    files then pass the `XML_PARSE_NONET` option which will disable network access.
